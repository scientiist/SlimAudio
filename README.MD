Generally, playing sound files is a hassle. As a game developer, I find myself often 
repeatedly listening to and modifying short audio clips. Booting up Windows
Media Player or whatever the fuck every 0.3 seconds gets annoying fast. So I created
a small, simple, and fast program to replay soundfiles via command line.
Use the code for your own shit, at your own risk. I'm not buying you a new subwoofer if
you nuke it by accident lol.
